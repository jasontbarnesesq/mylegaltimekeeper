🎤 My Legal Timekeeper

Professional time tracking made simple with voice recognition and smart automation
What is My Legal Timekeeper?

My Legal Timekeeper is a voice-enabled time tracking application designed for legal professionals, consultants, and anyone who needs to track billable hours efficiently. Instead of filling out tedious forms, simply speak your time entries naturally and let the app handle the rest.
Key Features
🎤 Voice Input

Speak your time entries naturally. The app asks questions conversationally to capture all details - no typing required.
⌨️ Manual Entry

Prefer typing? Switch to manual mode for traditional form-based entry with all the same features.
📊 Complete Tracking

Track client names, matters, time types (billable/non-billable/pending), detailed narratives, and hours worked.
📤 Easy Export

Export your time entries to CSV format for easy importing into billing systems, Excel, or other tools.
☁️ Google Drive Integration

Optionally connect your Google Drive to automatically save CSV exports to the cloud for backup and access.
🔔 Daily Reminders

Set up automatic browser notifications to remind you to log your time at the end of each workday.
How It Works

    Start a new entry: Click the microphone button to use voice input or switch to manual mode for typing
    Provide details: Answer simple questions about the client, matter, time type, work performed, and hours spent
    Review entries: See all your entries for today with running totals and detailed breakdowns
    Export data: Click "Export CSV" to download your time records in a format compatible with billing systems
    Optional: Connect Google Drive to automatically save exports to the cloud for safekeeping

🔒 Privacy & Data Security

Your data stays yours. All time entries are stored locally in your browser using secure browser storage. If you choose to connect Google Drive, files are saved only to your personal Google Drive account that you control.

We never:

    Access your data without permission
    Share your information with third parties
    Sell your data
    Track your activity across other websites

Google Drive Integration (Optional)

When you enable Google Drive integration, the app will:

    Request permission to create files in your Google Drive (you can revoke this anytime in your Google Account settings)
    Automatically save CSV exports to your Google Drive for backup and easy access
    Use your email address for authentication purposes only

What we DON'T do: We never access files you didn't explicitly create with this app. We don't read your emails, calendar, photos, or any other Google data. The app only has permission to create new files that you explicitly export.
Who Should Use This?

    Lawyers and legal professionals who need to track billable hours for client billing
    Consultants managing time across multiple clients and projects
    Freelancers logging project hours for invoicing
    Contractors who need detailed time records for billing or productivity analysis
    Anyone who wants an easier way to track their work time without manual form filling

Why Voice-Enabled?

Traditional time tracking requires switching between tasks, opening forms, and typing details. With voice input, you can quickly log time entries by speaking naturally while the app handles the data entry. This means:

    Less interruption to your workflow
    Faster entry - speaking is quicker than typing
    More accurate narratives - natural speech captures more detail
    Easier end-of-day logging - just talk through your day
